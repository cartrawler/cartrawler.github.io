##### Booking Card Redesign
* The booking cards on the landing page have been redesigned and now include the booking status. This is synced with our manage booking portal so that users can see their booking status (Confirmed, Unconfirmed, Cancelled, Completed) at a glance when the SDK is started. 
* Tapping a booking card now opens a new booking sheet which includes links to view more details of the booking or manage it on the customer portal. 

##### Enhancements
