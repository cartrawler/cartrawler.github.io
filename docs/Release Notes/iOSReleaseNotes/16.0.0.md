{: .no_toc }

## Main changes
- Mininum iOS version increased from 11.0 to 13.0
- Project settings updgraded to version 1620

`CTContext` and `CTAPIQueryParams` don't allow multiple passengers anymore, instead of passing an array, a single CTPassenger must be set, for example:

```swift
let passenger = CTPassenger()

// Change from
context.passenger = [passenger]

// To
context.passenger = passenger
```

## Minor changes

- Removed deprecations `isPrimaryDriver` property and `primaryDriverFromPassengers` method from CTPassenger.
- Removed deprecated property `accentColor` from CTStyle.
- Reduced nullability of our CTVehicleDetails object params.
