The CarTrawler SDKs come prepackaged with four widgets.

When considering the addition of a new touchpoint into the CarTrawler flow from within your app, you can choose the one that best suits your needs. <br/>
They can can also be combined to show different states of the basket.

<b>Example Use Case:</b> <br/>
<small>in a flight booking scenario you might want to display a widget to advertise you can add a rental car to your basket at various points in the flow. This is entirely optional though, in some cases it may be more beneficial to create your own UI using data from our APIs.</small>
