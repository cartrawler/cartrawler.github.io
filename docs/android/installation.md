# Installation

To add the CarTrawlerSDK to your app, add our maven repository and enter your artifactory credentials.

---

## Maven & Artifactory

### Add our maven repository and enter the artifactory credentials

```java
// Add to root build.gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url "http://artifactory.cartrawler.com/artifactory/libs-release-local"
        credentials { 
            username = "your_username_here" 
            password = "your_password_here" 
        }
    }
}

// CarTrawler dependency (Add to module build.gradle)
            
// Please use the version number sent to you by the CarTrawler team
implementation "com.cartrawler.android:car-rental:$latestVersion" 
```

Create a theme that extends the ```CTDayNightTheme```. Please refer to the <a href="/docs/android/customisation/themes" target="_blank">theme section</a> for further details.

## App Permissions

On the SDKâ€™s Search Screen, we have added the option for users to search for vehicles using their current location upon tapping the pick-up location EditText.

To make use of this feature, please ensure your Manifest has either the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.

We will need to use this when asking for permission to use location services within your app if it has not already been granted.
