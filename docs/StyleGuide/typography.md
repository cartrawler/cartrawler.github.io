## Font Colours on Light Backgrounds

Colour is applied sparingly to text in the Native SDK to ensure WCAG AA Level standard for accessibility. Dark text is used for main blocks of text in the interface and in cases where text is overlaying light colour components.

## Font Colours on Colour Backgrounds

By default, light or dark text should be used on colour backgrounds. Light text should be used on colour backgrounds when the contrast ratio meets the WCAG recommended 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

## Theming Examples

By default, the colour for text and icons on colour backgrounds are white for the native SDK. If your brand colours are a bright colour (high luminosity), it is recommended you change to a light theme for legibility of text and icons.
