# Widgets
{: .no_toc }

The CarTrawler iOS SDK comes prepackaged with four widgets.<br /><br /> When considering the addition of a new touchpoint into the CarTrawler flow from within your app, you can choose the one that best suits your needs, but these are entirely optional. In some cases it may be more beneficial to create your own UI using data from our APIs.
