##### Accessibility

We recommend meeting WCAG AA Level for background colours, text and icons. For colours used on backgrounds of components, a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text is recommended.

Our components with colour use white as the default overlay text colour. If your brand colour does not meet the recommended contrast ration with the white text, we recommend using dark text to meet the contrast ration.

##### Font Colours on Light Backgrounds

Colour is applied sparingly to text in the Native SDK to ensure WCAG AA level standard for accessibility. Dark Text is used for the main blocks of text in the interface and in cases where text is overlaying light colour components

##### Font Colours on Colour Backgrounds

Bt default, light or dark text should be used on colour backgrounds. Light text should be used on colour backgrounds when the contrast ratio meets the WCAG recommended 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
