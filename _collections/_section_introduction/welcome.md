* Currently there are two business flows (implemented in SDK):  Standalone, Inpath Rental.
* It should be noted that the Inpath Rental solution requires **additional backend development effort** and orginazation between CarTrawler and Partners.

**Workflows**
* Standalone - Allows the customer to reserve a car rental product independently from the flight.
* Standalone deeplink - Variant on the standalone flow whereby customer is presented with the vehicle list based on the pickup and dropoff parameters passed to the SDK, rather than the regular initial search screen.
* Inpath Rental - Allows a customer to reserve a car rental product to accompany their flight, this product forms part of the customerâ€™s  flight itenary.
