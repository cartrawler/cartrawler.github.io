<h5>To initialise the SDK with standalone flow you need to implement the SDK builder as follows:</h5>

  ```java
 CartrawlerSDK.Builder()
            .setRentalStandAloneClientId(clientId = "12345") // Ask your partner manager for your client id
            .setAccountId("CZ638817950")
            .setCountry(countryISO)
            .setCurrency(currency)
            .setEnvironment(environment)
            .setFlightNumberRequired(true)
            .setLogging(true)
            .setOrderId("123")
            .setPassenger(passenger(countryISO))
            .setVisitorId("123")
            .setTheme(R.style.SampleTheme)
            .startRentalStandalone(activity, requestCode = REQUEST_CODE_STANDALONE)
  ```

<h5>To support a deeplink to the availability screen you need to add pinned veh ref along with the drop off time, pick up time and the pickup and drop off locations as follows:</h5>

 ```java
 CartrawlerSDK.Builder()
            .setPickupTime(pickupDateTime = GregorianCalendar())
            .setDropOffTime(dropOffDateTime = GregorianCalendar()
            .setPickupLocation(iataAirportCode = "YXJ")
            //.. Add your other config properties as normal
  ```

<h5>Reservation Retrieval from Standalone Process</h5>

If a user booked a car during the standalone process, the onActivityForResult will be fired.
The reservation object is accessed via the return intent by onActivityForResult:

```kotlin
returnIntent.getStringExtra(CartrawlerSDK.RESERVATION)
    
    override fun onActivityForResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
       if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
           if (requestCode == 123) {
                yourMethod(data!!.getStringExtra(CartrawlerSDK.RESERVATION))
            }      
    }
    
    // The Reservation Object is defined as the following
    
    data class ReservationDetails (
       // In this scernario it will be confirmed

<h5>Present Standalone with Deeplinking</h5>

This is a variant on the standalone flow whereby the vehicle list is shown based on the pickup and dropoff parameters, rather than the regular initial search screen.
Optionally, if a vehicle refId is provided, this will be become the pinned item in the list.
If a user backs out of the list, it will return the user to the Cartrawler search.

- If the pickup and drop off dates are invalid, out of date, or not present the SDK will fallback to regular standalone search.
- If the vehicle refId is invalid (or out of date), the list will be shown without the vehicle being pinned.
- If the parameters are valid but no search results are returned by the CarTrawler system, the SDK will fallback to the regular standalone search.

setPinnedVehicle call is optional, as ths is on dependent on whether the vehicle is known (by Partner App), if know this becomes the pinned item in the list.

setDropOffTime, setPickupLocation (or setDropOffLocationID/setPickupLocationId), setPickupTime, are required so that the list is displayed (rather then the search).
